SharpSHPBuilder
===============

This is a fork of OS SHP Builder 3.3x (an open source application to edit .SHP/.PAL files), this time, coded in C# and aimed to be cross-platform.

It is based on Banshee's, Stucuk's and Zaaz's work.
Check http://www.ppmsite.com/forum/index.php?f=121 for more details about the original software.
