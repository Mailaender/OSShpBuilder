SharpSHPBuilder
===============

###What is it?
A tool for SHP manipulation and creation (mainly for [OpenRA](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA)).

###Why make it?
Discover the inspiraton [here](http://www.ppmsite.com/forum/index.php?f=121).

* Remove Windows-only restriction 
* Provide a UI for parts of [OpenRA.Utility](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/tree/bleed/OpenRA.Utility)
* Learn GUI construction

###Why use it?
You shouldn't expect much of this for the next year and possibly more.

* You want to create/edit SHP files in an interface
* You aren't on a Windows system
* Beta tools are fun!
